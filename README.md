# MS274 Project - Investigating Remotely Sensed Environmental Drivers of Rockfish Recruitment in the California Current System

A repository for the MS 274 project at MLML fall 2024 semester. 

## Project Description 
Eastern Boundary Upwelling Ecosystems (EBUE) are one of the oceanâ€™s most productive marine ecosystems because of the deep, cold, nutrient-rich water being upwelling along coastlines. A local example of an EBUE is the California Current System (CCS), where nearshore upwelling in the primary driver of seasonal fluctuations in dissolved oxygen, temperature, nutrient availability, and other biogeochemical parameters. One example of upwelling influencing  population dynamics is by affecting the recruitment of marine populations. This study utilizes two remotely sensed data sets, sea surface temperature and wind velocity, paired with an upwelling index to investigate (1) which environmental drivers (sea surface temperature, wind velocity, and upwelling strength) best predict young-of-year abundance for blue rockfish (a mid-water species) and copper rockfish (a benthic species) from 2003-2019 and (2) how are these environmental variables of sea surface temperature, wind velocity, and upwelling strength correlated with each other? By comparing the recruitment dynamics of species with contrasting life history strategies, this study aims to see if remotely sensed environemtal variables display similar trends to insitu measuremnts previously stated in the literature.
