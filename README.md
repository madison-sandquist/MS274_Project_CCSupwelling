# MS274 Project - California Current System Upwelling
A repository for the MS 274 project at MLML fall 2024 semester. 

## Project Description 
Eastern Boundary Upwelling Ecosystems (EBUE) are one of the ocean’s most productive marine ecosystems because of the deep, cold, nutrient-rich water being upwelling along coastlines. A local example of an EBUE is the California Current System (CCS), where nearshore upwelling in the primary driver of seasonal fluctuations in dissolved oxygen, temperature, nutrient availability, and other oceanographic parameters that have biological implications. Understanding how upwelling, which is driven by northerly winds in the CCS, influences these biologically relevant oceanographic parameters is important for understanding how populations and communities of marine organisms respond to physical ocean forces. Furthermore, these upwelling favorable winds are expected to increase due to anthropogenic climate change. The objective of this research is to understand the correlation between upwelling favorable winds and sea surface temperature over the past 20 years within the CCS, then see how well these parameters match a futuristic biogeochemical model for the CCS that was published in 2021. Two remotely sensed data sets will be used to disseminate the correlation– wind speed/direction and sea-surface temperature. These two parameters will then be compared to outputs for temperature and dissolved oxygen from a regional oceanic modelling system (ROMS) downscaled from three different earth system models (ESMs).
