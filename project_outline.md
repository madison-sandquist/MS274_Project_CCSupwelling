## Downscaled ROMS ESM Model 
The model output that will be used is currently not pubicially availible. 

## Potential Figures
1) A time series of all the parameters from each of the datasets (SST from remote sensing, Wind speed and direction, and SST from ROMS)
2) Two heat maps one from the SST of remote sensed data and one from the SST of the ROMS model
